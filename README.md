# RailwayDesigner
Railway designing game made with odin
 
Remaking the unfinished unity project in odin to:
- Getting used to procedural languages
- Learning about OpenGL and glsl
- I can't help myself from starting a new project before finishing the previous one.

### Planned features
- Creating new tracks
- Connecting multiple tracks altogether
- Setting lines for trains
- Running multiple trains with multiple cars on the set lines
